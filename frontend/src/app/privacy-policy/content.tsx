                Some countries and states set a higher age at which an individual can
                consent to the processing of their own Personal Information. Where We rely
                on consent as a legal basis and the law applicable to a User sets an age
                higher than 16, We may require the consent of that User's parent or guardian
                before We collect and use their Personal Information.
